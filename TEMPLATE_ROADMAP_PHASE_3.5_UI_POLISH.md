## Risk Register

### Top Risks
1. **Scope creep:** Too much polish, timeline extends
   - **Mitigation:** Prioritize must-have vs. nice-to-have
   - **Monitoring:** Track time per task
   - **Trigger:** If > 50% over estimate, defer non-critical items

2. **Performance regressions:** Polish features slow down app
   - **Mitigation:** Profile before and after changes
   - **Monitoring:** Lighthouse scores, FPS monitoring
   - **Trigger:** If performance drops, revert and optimize

3. **Accessibility issues:** Missing compliance requirements
   - **Mitigation:** Test early and often with tools
   - **Monitoring:** Automated a11y tests
   - **Trigger:** If critical issues found late, extend phase
