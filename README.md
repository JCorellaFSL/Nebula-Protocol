4. Green indicator means it's active ‚úÖ

### Test the Connection

In Cursor chat, try:
```
"Use the nebula-framework MCP to list available framework files"
```

Or:
```
"Fetch the Rust Nebula adaptation using MCP"
```

If the MCP is working, I'll be able to access your framework documentation directly!

## üöÄ Quick Start: 3 Steps to AI-Powered Development

### Step 1: Choose Your Framework Adaptation
Pick the adaptation that matches your project:

```bash
# For Flutter projects
Use: FLUTTER_NEBULA_ADAPTATION.md

# For Tauri projects  
Use: TAURI_NEBULA_ADAPTATION.md

# For Python projects
Use: PYTHON_NEBULA_ADAPTATION.md

# For Rust projects
Use: RUST_NEBULA_ADAPTATION.md

# For Dioxus projects  
Use: DIOXUS_NEBULA_ADAPTATION.md

# For other frameworks
Use: Nebula_Protocol.md (generic)
```

### Step 2: Load Framework into Your AI Tool

#### For AI-IDEs (Cursor, Windsurf, etc.)
1. **Open your project** in your AI-IDE
2. **Add framework files** to your project root or docs folder
3. **Reference the framework** in your AI conversations:
   ```
   "I'm using the Nebula Framework for project organization. 
   Please refer to FLUTTER_NEBULA_ADAPTATION.md for guidance."
   ```

#### For Chat-based AI (GPT, Claude, Gemini)
1. **Upload the framework file** to your conversation
2. **Set the context** with this prompt:
   ```
   Please use the attached Nebula Framework document as a reference 
   for structuring and developing my [Flutter/Tauri/Python/Rust/Dioxus] project. 
   Follow the Nebula (main roadmap) and Constellation (phase-specific) 
   pattern for all development discussions.
   ```

### Step 3: Create Your Project Structure

#### Critical: Generate ALL Constellations at Initialization
- Generate every `ROADMAP_PHASE_[NUMBER]_[DESCRIPTOR].md` file for all planned phases upfront (e.g., 0‚Äì4). Do not create them one-by-one later; incomplete constellation sets lead to architectural gaps and unsafe assumptions.
- Each constellation can start with placeholders, but the file must exist with headings, acceptance criteria stubs, and validation checklist.
- Example prompt to your AI tool:
  ```
  Generate the full set of constellation documents now for phases 0 through 4
  using the Nebula pattern. Include headings, acceptance criteria placeholders,
  testing strategy sections, and validation checklists for each phase.
  ```

#### HOLD 1: Per‚ÄëConstellation Conflict Review (during generation)
- For each newly generated constellation, run a quick review against all prior constellations:
  - Check for conflicts: tasks that supersede, duplicate, or nullify previous tasks
  - Check for phase fit: tasks better aligned to earlier/later phases
  - Check dependencies: ensure prerequisites are satisfied or linked
- Example prompt:
  ```
  Review ROADMAP_PHASE_2_FEATURES.md against phases 0‚Äì1 for conflicts,
  supersession, duplication, and mis-phasing. Propose reassignments or edits and
  list explicit rationale and updated dependencies.
  ```

#### HOLD 2: Global Constellation Review (after all are generated)
- Perform a whole-plan pass to suggest re-ordering, merging/splitting tasks, and dependency fixes.
- Ensure high-risk/infrastructure items occur before features dependent on them.
- Example prompt:
  ```
  Evaluate phases 0‚Äì4 for ordering and dependency correctness. Identify tasks to
  move between phases, merges/splits, and risks if sequence is unchanged. Output
  a proposed diff of phase assignment per task with justification.
  ```

#### A. Start with the Nebula (Main Roadmap)
Create `ROADMAP.md` using this template:

```markdown
# [Project Name] - Nebula Roadmap

## Project Overview
[Brief description of your project]

## Technology Stack
- Framework: [Flutter/Tauri/Python/etc.]
- Key Technologies: [List main technologies]
- Target Platforms: [Specify platforms]

## ü§ñ Working with AI: Best Practices

### Setting Up AI Context
When starting a new AI conversation:

1. **Load the framework**: Upload or reference your chosen adaptation
2. **Set the project context**: "I'm working on a [Flutter/Tauri/Python] project using the Nebula Framework"
3. **Specify current phase**: "I'm currently in Phase [X] focusing on [description]"
4. **Reference constellation**: "Please refer to ROADMAP_PHASE_[X]_[NAME].md for detailed requirements"

### AI Conversation Patterns

#### Starting a New Feature
```
"I need to implement [feature] as part of Phase [X]. 
Please refer to ROADMAP_PHASE_[X]_[NAME].md for the specific 
requirements and testing criteria."
```

#### Requesting Code Implementation
```
"Please implement [feature] following the Nebula Framework 
validation pattern: code -> test -> validate -> document.
Include the testing approach in your response."
```

#### Troubleshooting Issues
```
"I'm having issues with [problem] in Phase [X]. 
Please help debug this while maintaining the framework's 
testing and validation standards."
```

### The Critical Rule: Test-Validate-Proceed
**Every AI-generated feature must be:**
1. **Implemented** by the AI
2. **Tested** immediately by you
3. **Validated** against acceptance criteria
4. **Documented** with test results
5. **Approved** before proceeding to next task

## üîß Framework Integration Examples

### Example 1: Flutter App with Cursor
1. Open Flutter project in Cursor
2. Add `FLUTTER_NEBULA_ADAPTATION.md` to project
3. Create `ROADMAP.md` and phase constellations
4. Use Cursor's AI to implement features by referencing specific constellations
5. Test each feature immediately using hot reload
6. Validate against constellation acceptance criteria

### Example 2: Tauri App with Claude
1. Upload `TAURI_NEBULA_ADAPTATION.md` to Claude conversation
2. Create project structure following Nebula pattern
3. Ask Claude to implement features phase by phase
4. Test each implementation locally
5. Update constellation documents with progress

### Example 3: Python Project with GPT
1. Share `PYTHON_NEBULA_ADAPTATION.md` with GPT
2. Create detailed constellation documents for each phase
3. Use GPT to generate code following framework patterns
4. Run tests and validate functionality
5. Document results and proceed to next phase

## üìã Daily Workflow

### Morning Setup
1. Review current constellation document
2. Identify next tasks to implement
3. Load framework context into AI tool
4. Begin development session

### Development Cycle
1. **Ask AI** to implement next feature from constellation
2. **Test immediately** - manual or automated
3. **Validate** against acceptance criteria
4. **Document** test results
5. **Update** constellation with progress
6. **Repeat** for next feature

### End of Day
1. Update constellation documents with progress
2. Note any issues or decisions made
3. Plan next day's tasks
4. Commit changes to version control

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "AI doesn't understand my project context"
- **Solution**: Ensure framework document is loaded and referenced
- **Check**: Are you mentioning the specific constellation document?

#### "Generated code doesn't match requirements"
- **Solution**: Point AI to specific constellation sections
- **Check**: Are acceptance criteria clearly defined?

#### "Features break existing functionality"
- **Solution**: Emphasize testing and validation in AI prompts
- **Check**: Are you testing immediately after each implementation?

#### "Progress tracking is difficult"
- **Solution**: Update constellation documents after each completed task
- **Check**: Are you documenting test results and validation outcomes?

## üìä Success Metrics

### Project Health Indicators
- **Completion Rate**: Tasks completed vs. planned in each constellation
- **Quality Score**: Percentage of features passing validation on first try
- **Issue Resolution**: Time to resolve bugs and integration problems
- **Documentation Currency**: How up-to-date constellation documents are

### Framework Effectiveness
