# ROADMAP_PHASE_1.5_BASIC_UI - Basic User Interface

## Phase Overview
**MANDATORY PHASE - DO NOT SKIP**

This phase ensures that all core backend functionality implemented in Phase 1 has a functional, usable user interface. The goal is to make the application testable and usable by humans, preventing the "ready but broken" scenario where code exists but users cannot interact with it.

**Connection to Nebula:** Implements basic UI for all Phase 1 core features
**Dependencies:** Phase 1 (Core Development) must be complete
**Version Target:** 0.3.0 (upon completion)

### Objectives
- Create functional UI for all Phase 1 features
- Enable manual testing of all implemented functionality
- Establish UI patterns and component structure
- Make application usable for feedback and validation

### Success Criteria
- ✅ Every backend feature has corresponding UI component
- ✅ Users can navigate between screens/views
- ✅ All implemented features are accessible and testable
- ✅ Basic styling applied (visually coherent, not production-ready)
- ✅ Manual testing checklist completed with screenshots
- ✅ No console errors or critical warnings

### Task 3: Feature Screen Implementation (Repeat for Each Feature)
**Description:** Create UI screens/views for each Phase 1 feature

**For Each Feature:**
1. **List/Overview Screen:**
   - Display data from backend
   - Search/filter functionality (if applicable)
   - Navigation to detail views

2. **Detail/View Screen:**
   - Show individual item details
   - Display all relevant data
   - Navigation back to list

3. **Create/Edit Form:**
   - Input fields for all data
   - Form validation
   - Submit to backend
   - Success/error feedback

4. **Actions/Operations:**
   - Buttons for all backend operations
   - Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions
   - Loading indicators during operations
   - Result feedback (success/error messages)

**Acceptance Criteria per Feature:**
- [ ] Can view existing data
- [ ] Can create new items
- [ ] Can edit existing items
- [ ] Can delete items (with confirmation)
- [ ] All operations provide feedback
- [ ] Error messages are clear and helpful

**Testing Method:**
1. Open feature screen
2. Perform each CRUD operation:
   - Create: Add new item, verify it appears
   - Read: View item details, verify data correct
   - Update: Edit item, verify changes saved
   - Delete: Remove item, verify it's gone
3. Test error scenarios (invalid input, network errors)
4. Screenshot each screen state

**Logging:**
```
[INFO] Feature screen opened: User Management
[INFO] User created: {id: 123, name: "Test"}
[ERROR] Failed to save user: Validation error - email required
[INFO] User deleted: {id: 123}
```

---

### Task 4: Error Handling & User Feedback
**Description:** Implement comprehensive error handling and user feedback mechanisms

**Implementation Details:**
- Toast/snackbar notifications for operations
- Error message display for failed operations
- Loading spinners/progress indicators
- Form validation feedback
- Empty states (no data available)

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Loading states shown during async operations
- [ ] Success messages for completed actions
- [ ] Error messages for failed actions
- [ ] Form validation errors displayed inline
- [ ] Empty states with helpful messages

**Testing Method:**
- Trigger success scenarios, verify positive feedback
- Trigger error scenarios (disconnect network), verify error handling
- Submit invalid form data, verify validation messages
- View empty data sets, verify empty state displays

**Logging:**
```
[INFO] Operation started: Loading user list
[INFO] Operation complete: 15 users loaded
[ERROR] Operation failed: Network timeout after 30s
[WARN] Form validation failed: Invalid email format
```

---

### Task 5: Basic Styling & Visual Coherence
**Description:** Apply basic styling to make UI visually coherent (not production-ready)

**Implementation Details:**
- Consistent color scheme (primary, secondary, error colors)
- Typography (fonts, sizes, weights)
- Spacing and padding (consistent margins)
- Button styles (primary, secondary, destructive)
- Form input styles

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Consistent color palette applied
- [ ] Text is readable (contrast, size)
- [ ] Buttons have clear visual states (hover, active, disabled)
- [ ] Forms are clearly laid out
- [ ] App feels cohesive (not beautiful, but consistent)

**Testing Method:**
- Visual inspection of all screens
- Click all interactive elements, verify visual feedback
- Compare screens side-by-side for consistency
- Get feedback from team member

**Logging:**
```
[INFO] Theme applied: light mode
[DEBUG] CSS loaded: main.css, components.css
```

## Risk Register

### Top Risks
1. **UI framework learning curve:** May take longer than expected
   - **Mitigation:** Use official examples, reference documentation
   - **Monitoring:** Track time spent on framework-specific issues
   - **Trigger:** If blocked > 2 hours, seek help or switch approach

2. **Integration with Phase 1 backend:** API/interface mismatches
   - **Mitigation:** Test integration early and often
   - **Monitoring:** Log all API calls and responses
   - **Trigger:** If > 3 integration issues, review Phase 1 interfaces

3. **Scope creep:** Adding features beyond basic UI
   - **Mitigation:** Focus on "usable" not "beautiful"
   - **Monitoring:** Review task list daily
   - **Trigger:** If falling behind, defer polish to Phase 3.5

## Phase Invariants

### Entry Conditions (Must be true to start Phase 1.5)
- [ ] Phase 1 (Core Development) marked complete
- [ ] All Phase 1 backend features tested and working
- [ ] API/interfaces documented

- [ ] Perform all CRUD operations for each feature
- [ ] Test error scenarios (network disconnect, invalid input)
- [ ] Verify loading states appear and disappear
- [ ] Check console for errors
- [ ] Test on target platform(s)

### Test Scenarios per Feature
Create a table for each feature:

| Action | Expected Result | Actual Result | Pass/Fail | Screenshot |
|--------|----------------|---------------|-----------|------------|
| Open feature screen | Screen loads, data displayed | [Result] | ✅/❌ | link |
| Create new item | Item appears in list | [Result] | ✅/❌ | link |
| Edit item | Changes saved and visible | [Result] | ✅/❌ | link |
| Delete item | Item removed from list | [Result] | ✅/❌ | link |
| Invalid input | Error message shown | [Result] | ✅/❌ | link |

## Validation Checklist

- [ ] **Functionality:** All Phase 1 features accessible via UI
- [ ] **Usability:** Non-developer can test the application
- [ ] **Navigation:** Can move between all screens
- [ ] **Feedback:** User knows what's happening (loading, success, errors)
- [ ] **Errors:** All error cases handled gracefully
- [ ] **Manual Testing:** Checklist completed with evidence
- [ ] **Integration:** UI correctly calls backend/APIs
- [ ] **Documentation:** Testing results recorded
- [ ] **Dependencies Resolved:** No blocking issues from Phase 1
- [ ] **Risks Noted:** Risk register updated with issues found

## Quality Gate: Phase 1.5 Completion Review

### Review Questions
1. **Can someone use this app?** (Must be YES to proceed)
2. **Are there any Phase 1 features without UI?** (Must be NO)
3. **Did manual testing uncover issues in Phase 1?** (If YES, create Phase 1.01)
4. **Is the app stable enough for Phase 2 development?** (Must be YES)

### Decision
- [ ] **PROCEED** to Phase 2: No issues, UI is functional
- [ ] **CREATE Phase 1.5.01**: Minor UI fixes needed
- [ ] **ROLLBACK to Phase 1.01**: Backend issues found, must fix first
